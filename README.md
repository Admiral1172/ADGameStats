# Admiral's Stat Calculator
> Simple Calculator used to save stats for old video games that don't record them. 
> It can calculate K/D(Kill/Death), Record Scores, and Calculate Win/Loss and have the option to save them as text files.

## Future Plans
- Profiles to separate scores
- Averages between K/D, Scores, and Win/Loss Ratios
- Different types of stats
- Saving to XML instead of Text

## Instructions
- Need Visual Studio 2019 (Recommend Community)
